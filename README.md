## About

I'm Chad, an AWS Solutions Architect specializing in the automotive manufacturing sector. This series documents my real preparation for the AIP-C01 exam — building in public, shipping working code, learning as I go.

### A Note on the Plan

This is the target, not a guarantee. Life and work will get in the way — I'll probably miss a week here and there. The field is also changing fast; new tools and services may shift the path. I'll adapt as needed and document why.

The goal: walk into the exam with genuine hands-on confidence, not just memorized facts.
